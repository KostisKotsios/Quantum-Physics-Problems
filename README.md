## **Brief discription**

This directory contains `Jupyter Notebooks` for the `SymPy` courses, as part of the undergraduate course of **[Quantum Physics Problems](https://www.physics.auth.gr/courses/234) [ΓΘΕ204]** at Physics Department AUTh. The following notebooks are included:

[SymPy_Notes1](https://github.com/istergak/Quantum-Physics-Problems/blob/main/SymPy_Notes1.ipynb): Introduction to `SymPy`, symbols definition, substitution and numerical evaluation, symbolic functions, handling and manipulation of symbolic epxressions

[SymPy_Notes1_gr](https://github.com/istergak/Quantum-Physics-Problems/blob/main/SymPy_Notes1_gr.ipynb): Same as the notebook **SymPy_Notes1** but in greek

[SymPy_Notes2](https://github.com/istergak/Quantum-Physics-Problems/blob/main/SymPy_Notes2.ipynb): Linear algebra with `SymPy`: matrix operations, determinant, transpose and inverse of a matrix
